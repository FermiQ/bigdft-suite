These files are copied directly from libPAW VERSION 1.0
These should be synchronized constantly from ABINIT

How to SYNCHRONIZE?
1) copy files:
 cp [ABINIT]/src/42_libpaw/*F90 .

2) execute: ./run_format
This is important for BigDFT.

3) If new files have been added or removed:
 update ../Makefile.am

4) run makdep.sh as indicated in [BigDFT]/libABINIT/README
