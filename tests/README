'make check' is the command to perform the series of tests (optimisation of geometry):
- C    carbon atom 
- H    hydrogen atom
- Li+  lithium atom charged positively
- NaCl sodium chloride
- SiH4 silane

The input files are:
- input.dat for the parameters of calculations
- posinp    for the atomic position
            The format is the number of atoms + atomic, bohr or angstroem for units
            and per line coordinates and name of each atoms
- psppar.<name of atom> for the pseudopotentiel (ex, 'psppar.H_lda)
            Only GTH and HGH pseudopotentials are used (PRB 54, 1703 (1996))
            Pseudopotentials are available on ABINIT website (http://www.abinit.org)
- inguess.dat for the initial guess of wavefunctions (sum of gaussian functions)
            IF THIS FILE IS NOT PRESENT, THE INPUT GUESS IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED.
            The output file inguess.new is created with initial guess of wfs.
            We recommend to use the automatic generation

The directory 'Refs' contains the reference ouput files (gfortran 4.1.2)
A diff is performed after each calculations to check the accuracy.
