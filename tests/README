The command 'make check' performs the series of tests:
C/:             tests non-local pseudo-potential for isolated system
Ca2/:           tests adaptive mesh (by checking symmetry)
Davidson-SiH4/: tests Kohn-Sham eigenvalue calculations
FeHyb/:         tests the hybrid functional.
fft/:           low level test functionality.
GPU/:           tests GPU code (CUDA)
H/:             tests the hydrogen in a periodic box.
H2-freq/:       computes the vibration properties of the water molecule using finite differences.
H2O-CP2K/:      tests import wavefunctions from a gaussian basis set
H2O-slab/:      tests the calculation of dipolar surfaces.
H2-spin/:       uses the spin in the calculation of hydrogen atom.
Li+/:           calculates an isolated charged system.
MINHOP/:        tests global research using minima hopping
Mn2/:           tests non-collinear spin
NaCl/:          tests non-local pseudo-potential and adaptive mesh
NEB/:           runs NEB calculations.
NH3/:           shows the DIIS geometry relaxation to obtain saddle points.
PSolver/:       tests the Poisson solver implementation.
SiBulk/:        tests bulk silicon in periodic boundary conditions.
SiH4/:          tests the geometry relaxation for the silane molecule. Use the ASCII file format instead of the XYZ one.
XabsCheb/:      tests XANES calculations.


Executables (src directory):
----------------------------
bigdft (previously called cluster): run DFT ground state calculations with or without geometry relaxations.
memguess: read BigDFT inputs and provide an accurate estimation of memory requirement (for each CPU in case of MPI run). It can also ouput the grid with the option 'y'.
NEB: run a NEB path search (requires to provide also NEB_driver.sh and NEB_include.sh).
frequencies: run a finite difference calculation to find vibration for a molecule.
MDanaysis: browse the posout files generated during a molecular dynamic to compute several quantities, like the radial distribution g(r).
bart: EXPERIMENTAL, ART implementation using BigDFT for the force calculation.
abscalc: EXPERIMENTAL, compute XANES spectrum.

Test in parallel
----------------
Use the environment variable 'run_parallel' as:
export run_parallel='mpirun -np 2'
To use a batch system, add a batch file with:
export run_parallel=...
make check
