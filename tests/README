The command 'make check' performs the series of tests:
CUDA/:          tests CUDA implementation (GPU)
DFT/:           tests basic features of DFT calculations
fft/:           low level test functionality.
H2-freq/:       computes the vibration properties of the H2  molecule using finite differences.
MINHOP/:        tests global research using minima hopping
NEB/:           runs NEB calculations.
OpenCL/:        tests OpenCL code (GPU)
PSolver/:       tests the Poisson solver implementation.
XabsCheb/:      tests XANES calculations.


Executables (src directory):
----------------------------
bigdft:      run DFT ground state calculations with or without geometry relaxations.
memguess:    read BigDFT inputs and provide an accurate estimation of memory requirement (for each CPU in case of MPI run). 
             It can also ouput the grid with the option 'y'.
NEB:         run a NEB path search (the user must provide the files: NEB_driver.sh and NEB_include.sh).
frequencies: run a finite difference calculation to find vibration for a molecule.
MDanalysis:  browse the posout files generated during a molecular dynamic calculation to compute several quantities, 
             like the radial distribution g(r).
bart:        EXPERIMENTAL, ART implementation using BigDFT for the force calculation.
abscalc:     EXPERIMENTAL, compute XANES spectrum.
splsad:      EXPERIMENTAL, use spline saddle search method

Test in parallel
----------------
Use the environment variable 'run_parallel' as:
export run_parallel='mpirun -np 2'
To use a batch system, add a batch file with:
export run_parallel=...
make check
