'make check' is the command to perform the series of tests (optimisation of geometry):
- C    carbon atom 
- H    hydrogen atom
- NaCl
- SiH4

The input files are:
- input.dat for the parameters of calculations
- posinp    for the atomic position
            The format is the number of atoms + atomic, bohr or angstroem for units
            and per line coordinates and name of each atoms
- psppar.<name of atom> for the pseudopotentiel (ex, 'psppar.H_lda)
            In this version only GTH pseudopotentials are used (PRB 54, 1703 (1996))
            HGH will be available shortly
- inguess.dat for the initial guess of wavefunctions (sum of gaussian functions)

The directory 'Refs' contains the reference ouput files.
A diff is performed after each calculations to check the accuracy.
