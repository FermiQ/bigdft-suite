The command 'make check' performs the series of tests related to DFT calculations:
C/:             tests non-local pseudo-potential for isolated system and input.occ (occupation numbers)
Ca2/:           tests adaptive mesh (by checking symmetry)
Davidson-SiH4/: tests Kohn-Sham eigenvalue calculations
FeHyb/:         tests the hybrid functional.
GPU/:           tests DFT calculationw with GPU code (CUDA)
Graphene/:      tests k points with surface
                (Note: The box is too small for OpenCL version)
H/:             tests the hydrogen in a periodic box
                (Note: for OpenCL, the reference is not valid since wavelet localization is OFF but
                the calculation is correct)
H2O-CP2K/:      tests import wavefunctions from a gaussian basis set
H2O-slab/:      tests the calculation of dipolar surfaces.
H2-spin/:       uses the spin in the calculation of hydrogen atom.
Li+/:           calculates an isolated charged system.
Mn2/:           tests non-collinear spin
NaCl/:          tests non-local pseudo-potential and adaptive mesh
NH3/:           shows the DIIS geometry relaxation to obtain saddle points.
O2-Spin/:       tests spin restart 
OCL/:           tests DFT calculationa with OpenCL implementation
SiBulk/:        tests bulk silicon in periodic boundary conditions.
SiH4/:          tests the geometry relaxation for the silane molecule. Use the ASCII file format instead of the XYZ one.
TiMix/:         tests density mixing


Test in parallel
----------------
Use the environment variable 'run_parallel' as:
export run_parallel='mpirun -np 2'
To use a batch system, add a batch file with:
export run_parallel=...
make check
