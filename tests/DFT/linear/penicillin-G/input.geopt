SDCG
2         ncount_cluster: max steps during geometry relaxation
1.d0  0.  frac_fluct:     geometry optimization stops if force norm less than frac_fluct of noise
2.d-1     randdis:        random amplitude for atoms
0.5d0     betax: steepest descent step size,  if negative automatic determination
