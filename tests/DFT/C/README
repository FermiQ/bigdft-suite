 C atom calculation

 We use the file occup.dat in order to populate equally the 3 p states.

 WARNING: The input guess has not the correct symmetry due to the lapack library.
 There is a small overlap (1.e-6) between s and p states in Gaussian functions projected into wavelet basis sets
 and the 3 eigenvalues of p states are a diffrence of 1.e-6.
