 Estimation performed for 8 processors.
 Memory occupation for principal arrays:
               Poisson Solver Kernel (K):     1 MB   770 KB
              Poisson Solver Density (D):     1 MB   630 KB
     Single Wavefunction for one orbital:     0 MB   348 KB
    All Wavefunctions for each processor:     1 MB    18 KB
       Wavefunctions + DIIS per proc (W):    11 MB   198 KB
     Nonlocal Pseudopotential Arrays (P):     0 MB    83 KB
    Arrays of full uncompressed grid (U):    11 MB   594 KB
 Estimation of Memory requirements for principal code sections:
  Kernel calculation | Density Construction | Poisson Solver | Hamiltonian application
       ~19*K         |   W+~3*U+~ 3*D+K+P   |   ~12*D+K+W+P  |   W+~3*U+~ 3*D+K+P

 The overall memory requirement needed for this calculation is thus: 48 MB
 By reducing the DIIS history and/or increasing the number of processors the amount of
  memory can be reduced but for this system it will never be less than 44 MB
