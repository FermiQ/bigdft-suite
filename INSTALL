# ==================================
# "Basel" way to install the package
# ==================================
See also the doc/basel-make.sh script for an integrated script.

Run autotools using :
./autogen.sh


Choose the right option for your compilation :
export FC=/opt/intel/fc/9.0/bin/ifort   # Choose your Fortran Compiler
export MPI_INCLUDE=/opt/scali/include   # Set the include directory for MPI
export MPI_LDFLAGS=/opt/scali/lib       # Set the directory where to find MPI library
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/intel/mkl72/lib/32/ -lguide -lpthread -D_REENTRANT"

If the build environement is standard, none of these export is required.
They have to be adapted according to situation.


Configure the source directory :
./configure --enable-mpi --with-lapack=/opt/intel/mkl72/lib/32/libmkl_lapack.a --with-blas=/opt/intel/mkl72/lib/32/libmkl_ia32.a --prefix=/home/caliste/usr

The --enable-mpi option makes the source to compile with MPI support.
This option is enable by default and can be omited (use --disable-mpi not to compile with mpi support).
The --with-lapack and --with-blas option is to give the compiler the
position of required linear geometry libraries.
The --prefis option is to give the installation directory (when 'make install' is done),
this is not mandatory and /usr/local is default.
For further details about configure, type :
./configure -- help

IMPORTANT : from this point, the package is configured and previous steps are
no more required if no file is added or removed.


Make the package and create the 'cluster' executable :
make


Install the package :
make install


Clean the source tree of the 'make' action :
make clean


Clean the source tree from all generated informations :
make distclean

WARNING : doing 'make distclean' makes to restart from first point
to be able to compile the package again.


Create a tar with all needed sources:
make dist


#===================
# Building a library
#===================

It is possible to build a library in addition to the executable, that create
a static library and a module interface for Fortran90 use.

To do this, use the --enable-build-library option with the configure. This
option is disabled by default. Moreover, to avoid to create the binary executable,
use --disable--build-binary option.
