bigdft-suite is a suite of different packages mainly used to build the bigdft executable.

jhbuild.py from the gnome project is used to manage the configure scripts of each package.
bigdft-suite needs only an optimised lapack library and a fortran compiler with mpi.

The main script to use is Installer.py which is a driver for jhbuild.

When uncompacting bigdft-suite: tar xzvf bigdft-suite.tar.gz
A bigdft-suite directory is created.

mkdir build; cd build

Typing ../bigdft-suite/Installer.py help gives the help.

To indicate the required configuration, you can use the command-line option "-c" 
or specify with the option "-f" a rcfile, either from bigdft-suite/rcfiles/  or from CWD.
By default, Installer.py is trying to find a file rcfiles/`*hostname`*.rc if it exists.

At the end of the build, Installer.py will create a buildrc file in the current directory which will be used.

If everything goes smmothly, the command

../bigdft-suite/Installer.py build 

should therefore install the BigDFT suite in the install/bin directory of the build tree.

In some cases, you may need also to specify the LD_LIBRARY_PATH as
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:'location-of-your-build'/install/lib to specify mainly the location of libyaml.so
