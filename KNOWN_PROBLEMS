Roundoff errors:
----------------

T.D. 25/02/2007

- The routine Convolkinetic in the file convolut_optim.f90 is rather sensitive
to roundoff errors. 
This routine is by used  the routine preconditionall (precond_sg.f90)
[ preconditionall -> precong -> CALC_GRAD_REZA -> Convolkinetic ]
In this case, the xc energies are different up to 10^{-5} from the second iteration.
To see the propagation of the roundoff errors, uncomment th print statements in 
the routine precong (precond_sg.f90).
