DIIS:
-----

T.D. 30/10/2007
With Pt2 spin-ploarized, the DIIS algorithm decreases in energy and increases at the end.
gnrm always decreases.
It seems that the program converges to a higher-symmetry state than the ground one.
To avoid this behaviour, we will implement an algorithm which does not permit to increase the energy
during the iterations.
