## Definitions of the input variables
##inputvar: #name of the variable as declared in the code
## DESCRIPTION: Extended description of the variable to be used for documentation
## COMMENT: This is the description of the variable as will appear in the logfile
## RANGE: [from,to] #always put two numbers (also .inf can be put)
## EXCLUSIVE: #here follows a mapping of allowed values (either RANGE or EXCLUSIVE)
##  Value1:  comments of value1
##  Value2:  comment of value2
##  Alternatively, it follows a list of the allowed values without comments
## (to be considered in the case of self-explanatory values, e.g. list of integers)
##  [ Val1, Val2, Val3 ]
## CONDITION: #here the conditions for which the variable makes sense are written
##   MASTER_KEY: foo #this means that inputvar makes sense only if foo is specified
##   WHEN: #provide a list of allowed values of foo for which inputvar is meaningful
##     - fooval1
##     - fooval2
##   WHEN_NOT: #provide a list of forbidden values
##     - fooval3
##     - fooval4
## PROFILE_FROM: foo #inputvar inherit the profile from the one specified by foo variable
###then the profiles follows, which gives to the variables the allowed name
## default: value of the default, written as a string 
## profile1: value1 # if the user specifies inputvar: profile1 then inputvars will be value1
## profile2: value2
