@page DOCUMENTATION Developing the BigDFT documentation and some coding rules

At the beginning of each Fortran file, it is important to add the following lines:
@verbatim
!> @file
!! WHAT THIS FILE SHOULD PROVIDE
!! @author
!!    Copyright (C) 2005-2013 BigDFT group
!!    This file is distributed under the terms of the
!!    GNU General Public License, see ~/COPYING file
!!    or http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt .
!!    For the list of contributors, see ~/AUTHORS
@endvarbatim

Then before each routine or module inside the corresponding file, you add some lines of comment as:
@verbatim
!> Main program to calculate electronic structures
program BigDFT
@endverbatim

We recommend STRONGLY to use implicit none.

It is better to comment each argument of the routine in the same line of their declaration as:
@verbatim
   character(len=1), intent(in) :: geocode  !< @copydoc poisson_solver::doc::geocode
   character(len=1), intent(in) :: datacode !< @copydoc poisson_solver::doc::datacode
   integer, intent(in) :: iproc        !< Process Id
   integer, intent(in) :: nproc        !< Number of processes
   integer, intent(in) :: n01,n02,n03  !< Dimensions of the real space grid to be hit with the Poisson Solver
   logical, intent(in) :: use_gradient !< .true. if functional is using the gradient.
   logical, intent(in) :: use_wb_corr  !< .true. if functional is using WB corrections.
@endverbatim

In order to avoid the duplication, we will define dummy structure as doc in order to specify the usual name used as
arguments. Then you can insert as in the following example only @verbatim@copydoc poisson_solver::doc::geocode@endverbatim.
This means that doxygen will insert the documentation of the memeber geocode of the struture doc from the module
poisson_solver.

All variables and routines inside the modules should be commented.

Finally in the README file, you find the different pages related to the documentation of BigDFT.
