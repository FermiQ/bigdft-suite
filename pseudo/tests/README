@brief 
The initial import has tests for atom.f with a wide variety of chemical elements,
but only in relativistic Teter93 LDA (iXC = - 000 020 or 1, nspol=1).

Added some tests for nitrogen in polarized and nonrelativistic LDA and PBE,
as well as one test with VWN LDA, no confinement and several configurations (to compare with NIST DFT data).

There are no tests for the fitting application pseudo yet. 
Some crossover of tutorial and test for pseudo is found in ./example.O/INSTRUCTIONS.
