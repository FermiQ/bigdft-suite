What is pseudo2.5?
=================

Pseudo is a program to generate accurate, soft and transferable Goedecker-type pseudopotentials. 
The analytic form of the potentials is optimized using a downhill simplex method for least square
fitting of some empirical penalty function. Deviations from atomic all electron reference data are
summed to build that penalty function. These data include eigenvalues, charge integrals and nodes of
both, occupied and virtual orbitals, as well as excitation energies, i.e. energy differences between
ground states of different electronic configurations, which may be treated in parallel using MPI.
To improve the softness of the pseudowavefunctions for particular applications with BigDFTs wavelet
basis set, the valence orbitals may be transformed to Daubechie wavelets with real space grids of
various spacings. This allows to add the resulting deviation in the kinetic energy per orbital to
the penalty function as a systematic measure for softness. 
Note that this version of pseudo uses the libXC libraries for the exchange correlation functionals,
supports spin polarized or relativistic LDA and GGA calculations and allows the inclusion of non-
linear core corrections of a simple analytic form that may be fitted as well.


More information is given in the doc and Tutorial subdirectories.
