/*! @dir flib
@brief This directory contains the flib library (memory allocation, dictionaries, ...).

@dir flib/src
@brief Directory source of the flib library
@details
The <tt>src</tt> directory contains the different routine of the flib library:
- Dictionaries (see @ref dictionaries.f90)
- Dynamic memory management (see @ref dynamic_memory.f90)
- Yaml output  (see @ref yaml_strings.f90 and @ref yaml_output.f90)
- Exception Handling (see @ref error_handling.f90)


@dir flib/tests
@brief Contains some tests for the flib library
@details
The <tt>tests</tt> directory contains some useful examples and tests.


@defgroup flib    The Flib library
@brief
  The flib library is a low-level library used by BigDFT in order to do some low-level operations:
  - Define the dictionary type (see @ref flib_dictionary)
  - Memory allocations and memory profiling (see @ref flib_memory)
  - Routines to handle yaml output (see @ref flib_yaml)
  - Error handling (see @ref flib_error)


@defgroup flib_dictionary   Dictionary type and methods (flib)
@ingroup flib
@brief Flib dictionary type and its associated methods
@details
flib provides an object called dictionary. These dictionaries are used in the other parts of the flib library.
There are many examples in the file dicts.f90


@defgroup flib_yaml  Routines to write YAML output (flib)
@ingroup flib
@brief Flib yaml output routines
@details
flib provides routines to display YAML output.
There are many examples in the files yaml_test.f90 and yaml_invoice.f90.


@defgroup flib_memory  Dynamic Memory Management (flib)
@ingroup flib
@brief flib dynamic memory management
@details
flib provides routines to allocate, deallocate and trace the dynamic memory.
There are many examples in the file dynmem.f90


@defgroup flib_error  Error Handling (flib)
@ingroup flib
@brief flib error handling routines
@details
flib provides routines to handle the exceptions and the errors with a mechanism of callback routines.
There are many examples in the file errs.f90
