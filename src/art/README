/*!
This version of ART nouveau has been optimized for SIESTA and other cases where
the force evaluation is extremelly heavy. Because of that it saves the
configuration at every step during the activation. This version of ART nouveau
should not be used for empirical potential.

Log of changes
**************

Version 1.005   (17 March 2006)

Corrected a number of bugs related to the transfer of the forces from
SIESTA to siestart.   (NM)

Version 1.006   (23 March 2006)

Introduced the possibility to have many types of atom. 

Corrected a bug with respect to the creation of the xmol-type of type. To
get it right, it is now essential to at least give the type of one atom
in the siestart.sh file. For example, one should add, for SiO2:

setenv type1   Si
setenv type2    O


Version 1.007  (16 May 2006)

(1) Now saves refconfig after initial minimization

(2) Corrected Max_Number_Events in the code so that this variable affect
the program.

(3) Added a variable, Prefactor_Push_Over_Saddle, to allow for a fine tunig
of the push over saddle point. In general, the default value (0.15) is
fine, but it might lead in too large steps for SIESTA, from time to time.

(4) move the allocate command in find_saddle to avoid a crash during a
restart

(5) If LOGFILE already exists, it moves it before starting the simulation. 

(6) Removed some compilation errors for intel compiler


Version 1.008 (20 May 2006)

(1) Now allow to use a negative temperature to ensure that new
configurations are never accepted

(2) Also corrects a bug for when the  jump in energy is too large

Version 1.009

(1) properly writes the initial file name in events.list

Version 1.010

(1) properly writes the final fine name in events.list (....)


Version 2.0 (20 May 2008)

This new version includes many corrections made by Kevin Levasseur-Smith and Normand Mousseau. 

It also includes DIIS, proposed by Damien Caliste and a number of optimization proposed by Cosmin Marinica.
