 Sub-directories:
 - <b>  art </b>                ART method from Normand Mousseau
 - <b>  convolutions </b>       Convolutions for the Daubechies functions
 - <b>  convolutions-c </b>     Convolutions using C routines
 - <b>  CUDA </b>               Routines for the GPU part based on CUDA library from NVIDIA.
                                3D convolutions are coded.
 - <b>  init </b>               Initialization routines
 - <b>  lib </b>                Contains routines for the compilation (only fft)
 - <b>  modules </b>            Main modules of BigDFT package
 - <b>  OpenCL </b>             Routines for OpenCL acceleration
 - <b>  profiling </b>          Routines to profile the code (time and memory)
 - <b>  PSolver </b>            Contains Poisson solver routines
                                which can be compiled standalone as a library.
                                There are also the routines to build and manipulate
                                the interpolating scaling functions.
 - <b>  unused </b>             Contains deprecated routines (not documented)
 - <b>  wavelib </b>            Basic routines for wavelets
 - <b>  wfn_opt </b>            Wavefunction optimization
