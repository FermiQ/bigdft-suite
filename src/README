There are two programs:
- cluster (file BigDFT.f90)
- memguess (file memguess.f90) to estimate the necessary memory
  ex: memguess nproc

cluster and memguess read the input files (input.dat, posinp and psppar.<name of atom>) in the corresponding directory.

BigDFT.f90 performs a geometry optimization using a conjugate gradient algorithm and calls
the routine cluster (cluster_all.f90).

The file cluster_all.f90 contains the routine cluster and all routines called by ABINIT as BigDFT is interfaced.

Sub-directories:

- "profiling" contains routines to profile times and memories
- "PSolver" contains all routines for the different Poisson solver (isolated systems, surfaces, 3D periodic)
- "convolutions" contains the routine performing the convolution
