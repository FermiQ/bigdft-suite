In this version the application of the local potential on the wavefunction 
is done in a more efficient way. The wavefunction on the real space grid 'psir' 
is calculated directly from the scaling function and wavelet coefficients 
of the wavefunction without calculating an intermediate 'psifscf' (representation 
of the wavefunction in fine scaling functions). In addition the convolutions 
are now all done only for the nonzero coefficients and not over the entire 
rectangular box. THis required the introduction of additional 'ib....' arrays.
For the moment I send you only the routine 'convolut_simple.f90'. When I am back 
from holidays I will send you the optimized OpenMP version 'convolut_optim_omp.f90'
as well as OpenmP versions for other routines.
All the new routines were written by Alexey. So please contact him if you have questions. 

In the Bigdft.f90 main program I have at present commented out the geometry optimization 
part (call to call conjgrad).

In case you want to contact me, you can reach me during my holidays most of the time 
at 0049-8841-90179.
