(Py)BigDFT Tutorials
===================

In this page you may found different tutorials and exercises that will help you in the usage of BigDFT. There are two main different categories,
one associated to the _usage_ of the code to perform calculations, and 
the second is more related to the _post-processing_ tools that the PyBigDFT
package offers to ease the extraction of scientific data.
