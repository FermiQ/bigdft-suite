@mainpage BigDFT Package developer documentation
 The BigDFT project is an electronic structure calculations based on the Daubechies wavelet basis set.

<p>
<a href="http://bigdft.org">BigDFT</a> is a DFT massively parallel electronic structure code 
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html">GPL license</a>) using a wavelet basis set.
Wavelets form a real space basis set distributed on an adaptive mesh (two
levels of resolution in  our implementation).
</p>
<p>
GTH or HGH pseudopotentials are used to remove the core electrons.
Thanks to our Poisson solver based on a Green function formalism,  
periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with  
the proper boundary conditions.
