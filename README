BigDFT is a [//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory DFT] 
massively parallel electronic structure code ([//www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html GPL] license) using a wavelet basis set.
Wavelets form a real space basis set distributed on an adaptive mesh (two
levels of resolution in  our implementation). [//www.abinit.org/Psps/?text=../Psps/LDA_GTH/lda GTH] or
[//cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/cp2k/potentials/Goedecker/abinit/pbe/ HGH]
pseudopotentials are used to remove the core electrons.
Thanks to our Poisson solver based on a Green function formalism,  
periodic systems, surfaces and isolated systems can be simulated with  
the proper boundary conditions.
