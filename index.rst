Example of link  to :ref:`futile:futile_index`, followed by exemple
to :ref:`pybigdft:pybigdft_tutorials`, actualized .

   

Example of link :py:class:`zipfile.ZipFile` to python class 
or to :f:mod:`f/f_precisions` or maybe :py:func:`futile.Utils.find_files` this, or again :py:mod:`BigDFT.Logfiles`. If all these links are not broken, we may reach the following conclusion: *intersphinx* seems to work.
